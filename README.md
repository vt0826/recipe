## üßê What's inside?

A Website that will allow a user to create a cooking recipe . When creating a cooking recipe the user can add a ‚ÄúStep‚Äù to a recipe .
Each step will have the following content:

- \*Title (example : Cook eggs)
- \*Text associated with it to describe the step(example: Let eggs cook in pan for 5 minutes)
- \*The user will also be able to add images and links to videos to the step as well as optional content.

Once a recipe is completed I want to be able to select the recipe from a list of all recipes created by these users and execute it
